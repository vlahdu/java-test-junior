# Spring Boot Framework - Internship tasks

This repository contains a base project for internship program at GlobalDatabase, each candidate for position of
Junior Backend Developer must be able to develop all the tasks in the following lists.
Fork it and bring it to the next level.

### Workflow

1. Before starting this program you should know Java or another programming language at a level beginner, and understand
   syntax, variables, functions, algorithms, etc. If you have lacked in language understanding then start
   with https://www.learnjavaonline.org/
2. First milestone is to prove that you are ready for internship program
3. Before each milestone estimate each task in hours of work to understand how much time you need to achieve the finish,
   don't worry if your estimations are wrong because you don't have experience.
4. After each milestone or sequence of tasks create a merge request to your mentor to receive feedback, after code
   review you will have something to fix this will improve your coding skills
5. Be focused on tasks and ask questions when you don't understand something and you didn't find anything on Google (
   googling is a base skill for developers)

#### What will you learn

1. Work with spring mybatis
2. Work with spring data
3. Work with algorithms and data structures

### Tasks
